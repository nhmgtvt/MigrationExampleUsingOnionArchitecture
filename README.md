MigrationExample


#This is a sample project of data migration. Basically it load data from a file, sort the data then save the data to another file.
#Onion Architecture (http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/) was used to achieve flexibility

#What the program does
#Get external data in different format from outside (Read from file, database, web service call ...) 
#Convert external data to internal data
#Do some processing (sorting data)
#Save result (might be file, database ...)
